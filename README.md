I decided to redo my portfolio now that I have graduated from University of Arizona Coding Boot Camps to reflect the new things I have learned since gratuation. I am most proud of the dark mode and light mode feature and am happy with how smoothly the project went.

## Usage

To use my portfolio, open the React App in your web browser using the link below and then click on the various button in the navigation to travel around. In portfolio you can filter project by front-end, back-end, and full stack as well as expand the project details into a pop up modal. There is also a working contact form and the option to download my resume.
