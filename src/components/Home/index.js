          Welcome to my portfolio! I am currently the owner and manager of a
          small cosmetics brand and eCommerce store who is looking to pursue my
          dreams in web development. With an eye for design and aesthetics, a
          passion for seeing ideas become reality and experience in team
          building and collaboration, I feel like I would make a unique fit in
          your development team!
